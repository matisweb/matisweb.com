## Who am I?

I am Jafar Naghizadeh, a 35-year-old, **Iranian**, ***freelance web developer*** and web designer with more than a decade of experience in designing and making websites, web applications, and web shops. I've developed more than 10 major online services like blog-hosting and social networks.
I work with PHP and MySQL for back-end development, and working with HTML, CSS, Sass, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery for front-end development.

I have a bachelor's degree in Business Management and a master's degree in Management of Technology from the University of Tehran.

Besides my first languages, **Persian** and **Azerbaijani**, I speak **Turkish**, and I'm developing my **English** as my second and third language, and also learning **Dutch** since the beginning of 2023.
